# OOP_Template-Engine
A Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Also comes equipped with test for each page of javascript. 


## Getting Started
Once you have a copy of the project on your machine, open a CLI (command line interface). Navigate in the CLI to the OOP_Template-Engine directory. Type and enter "npm install". Once installation is complete, you can run the program by typing and entering "node app.js".
Complete the prompts to build a team, and the finished html doc will save in the output folder as team.html

Open team.html in browser to see the team page!
